        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A type of all-in-one rice bowl dish (known as Gai Fan/盖饭 in Chinese), Lu Rou Fan consists of braised fatty pork, hard-boiled eggs (flavoured in the meat broth), steamed rice and blanched veggies. Pork belly, the star component of the dish, is richly seasoned, cooked to an almost gelatinous texture and coated with a layer of sticky broth. Simply irresistible!</p>
