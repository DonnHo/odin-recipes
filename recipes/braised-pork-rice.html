        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A type of all-in-one rice bowl dish (known as Gai Fan/盖饭 in Chinese), Lu Rou Fan consists of braised fatty pork, hard-boiled eggs (flavoured in the meat broth), steamed rice and blanched veggies. Pork belly, the star component of the dish, is richly seasoned, cooked to an almost gelatinous texture and coated with a layer of sticky broth. Simply irresistible!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2lb of Pork Belly</li>
            <li>1 cup of Fried Shallots</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Dark Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp of Five Spice Powder</li>
            <li>2.5 tbsp of Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Chinese Cooking Wine</li>
            <li>3 cup of Water</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Hand chop pork belly into small stripes, YES, hand-chopped pork belly, a lot of manual work, but trust me, it is worth it! You want to have a little bit of skin, fat, and meat in each slice (Refer to the video tutorial for more information)
            </li>
            <li>Saute in the Instant Pot for 2-3 minute or until it is no longer pink 
            </li>
            <li>Add in soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, five-spice powder, sugar, and mix 
            </li>
            <li>Pour in 2 cups of water and set the instant pot to “pressure cook” for 20 minutes 
            </li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, quick release and add in 1 cup of fried dried shallots. Mix well to ensure everything is combined
            </li>
            <li>Pressure cook for another 15 minutes and let it natural release 
            </li>
            <li><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> if you want to make marinated eggs, instead of natural release, do a quick release and add in 8 peels of hard-boiled eggs and let it simmer for another 30 minutes.  
            </li>


        </ol>
