        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd.</p>

        <p>Smash burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic burgers, but that double burger patty with cheese melted in between is irresistible and you’ll love the special sauce.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong> – We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).</li>
            <li><strong>Sauce</strong>A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Burger Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Buns</strong>brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger look, but any burger bun will work</li>
            <li><strong>Lettuce</strong>thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style smash burger</li>
            <li><strong>Pickles</strong>sliced dill pickle chips are the best</li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and cut them into rings</li>
            <li><strong>Red onion</strong>thinly sliced into rings</li>
        </ul>
