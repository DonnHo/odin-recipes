        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd.</p>
        <p>Smash burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic burgers, but that double burger patty with cheese melted in between is irresistible and you’ll love the special sauce.</p>
